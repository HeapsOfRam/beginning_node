# beginning_node

A very simple, one page website that I am using in order to better understand Node.js as well as get familiar with things like Express, Jade, and Stylus.

I am essentially following [this tutorial](www.clock.co.uk/blog/a-simple-website-in-nodejs-with-express-jade-and-stylus) in order to make this application. Thank you to Ben Gourley for your helpful guide!
